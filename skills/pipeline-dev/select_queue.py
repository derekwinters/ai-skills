"""Queue selection for the pipeline-dev skill.

Reads a JSON snapshot of open issues on stdin and writes the nightly build
queue on stdout. Pure and deterministic — no GitHub I/O. The skill (SKILL.md)
gathers the snapshot via the GitHub MCP tools, runs this to decide *what* and
*in what order* to build, then drives `doggiehood-dev` over the result.

Two distinct dependency notions (see issue #197):

  * ``blocked_by`` — a HARD gate. An issue is not eligible until every hard
    blocker is closed/merged (i.e. no longer in ``open_issue_numbers``).
  * ``depends_on`` — an ORDERING hint used to topologically sort the eligible
    set so a prerequisite builds before its dependent. It does not gate
    eligibility; edges to non-eligible issues are ignored for ordering.

Input schema (stdin):
  {
    "focus_milestone": "04 - Quests & Economy",
    "cap": 3,
    "open_issue_numbers": [205, 210, 211, 212],

    ]
  }

Output schema (stdout):
